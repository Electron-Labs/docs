# Decentralizing the relayer network

The key feature that sets apart ZK Light client Bridges from a multi-sig bridge is that ZK bridges have permission-less relayer network. Multi-sig cannot decentralize their relayer network since they need to tightly control who manages the keys.

We need mutiple relayers in our cross-chain protocol to ensure high decentralization and liveliness.

Right now, we are just operating one relayer, but we should operate multiple ideally. Adding multiple relayers is easy, and we plan to invite more people to run them in future.
