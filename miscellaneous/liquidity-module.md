# Liquidity Module

A big problem with bridges is that they give you these wrapped assets that have little utility. This problem does not exist in our bridge, as we give the user native assets on both the sides. We achieve this via the use of liquidity pools that can convert wrapped assets to native assets and vice-versa.

Detailed design of our Liquidity module is given below.
