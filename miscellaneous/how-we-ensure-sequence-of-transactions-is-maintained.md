# How we ensure Sequence of Transactions is maintained

In our design, since the relayers are permissionless and anyone if free to send the information across, transactions that happened earlier on the source chain could end up reaching the destinatio chain after.

This means, that the destination chain could receive transactions in a different sequence than the one in which they happened on source chain. We believe maintaining sequence of transactions in a cross-chain setting is very important.

So how do we do that with Electron Protocol?
