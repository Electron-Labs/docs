# Overview

All existing bridges in the market reply on a centralized set of "operators" that are responsible for maintaining the security of bridges. These operators essentially operate a multi-sig that is responsible for signing off on the transaction to ensure their validity.

However, this makes the bridge technology centralized. Any applications built on such a bridge will be custodial by default. This prevents a true cross-chain ecosystem from emerging.
