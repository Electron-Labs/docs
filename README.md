# Introduction

Electron Protocol is a cross-chain protocol secured by on-chain light clients. We further use ZK-proofs to create succinct proofs of the NEAR and Ethereum Light Clients.

This enables us to create a fully permissionless and non-custodial bridging protocol.

This is unlike existing bridges which rely on centralized multi-sig operators.
