Building world's first decentralized cross-chain protocol powered by on-chain Light Clients and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

All existing bridges in the market reply on a centralized set of "operators" that are responsible for maintaining the security of bridges. These operators essentially operate a multi-sig that is responsible for signing off on the transaction to ensure their validity.

However, this makes the bridge technology centralized. Any applications built on such a bridge will be custodial by default. This prevents a true cross-chain ecosystem from emerging.

Hence, we are bringing a bridge that does not reply on "someone" to maintain the bridge. Just like Defi, a bridge should be able to run itself once deployed.
