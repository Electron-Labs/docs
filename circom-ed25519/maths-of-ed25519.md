# Maths of ED25519

ED25519 signature uses a curve and involves performing operations on this curve. Let's dive deeper.

All operations in this signature scheme are defined under modulo `p` where&#x20;

$$
p = 2^{255} - 19
$$

The curve equation is defined as follows:-

$$
ax^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2
$$

where `a = -1` and `d = - 121665/121666`

Base Point is defined as (Bx, By)

`Bx =15112221349535400772501151409588531511454012693041857206046113283949847762202`

`By =46316835694926478169428394003475163141307993866256225615783033603165251855960`

$$
By = 4/5

### Defining Point Addition&#x20;

Say you have two points P and Q on the curve. If we draw a straight line through P and Q, it will intersect the curve at another point R as shown in the diagram. When this happens, we say that R is the sum of points P and Q. This is how pt addition is defined. Now letâ€™s calculate R given P and Q.
